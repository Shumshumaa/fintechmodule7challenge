ETF ANALYZER WEB APP (with Viola)


This assignment, we built a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - For data manipulation and analysis.
* [hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - For interactive user prompts and dialogs
* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - To provide for an easier method to interact with the filesystem no matter what the operating system is.
* [sqalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) -  Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
* [voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) - Voilà turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications.
